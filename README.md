# Basic-Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript

## Description

This is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and has a user-friendly interface. It was designed to demonstrate my fundamental front-end development skills.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear button to reset the display.
- Responsive design suitable for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality of the calculator.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hxbeeb11/Basic-Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Basic-Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
    ```

3. Open `Calculator.html` in your web browser to view the calculator.

## Files

- `Calculator.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
- `calculator.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the calculator.
- `calculator.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the calculator.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`Calculator.html`)

The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the calculator, including the display and buttons for the numbers and operations.

### CSS (`Calculator.css`)

The CSS file styles the calculator, giving it a sleek and modern look. It includes styling for the display, buttons, and hover/active states.

### JavaScript (`Calculator.js`)

The JavaScript file provides the functionality for the calculator. It includes functions to append numbers and operations to the display, evaluate expressions, and clear the display.

## How It Works

- **Appending to Display**: When a button is clicked, the corresponding value is appended to the display.
- **Calculating the Result**: When the '=' button is clicked, the expression in the display is evaluated using the `eval` function, and the result is displayed.
- **Clearing the Display**: The 'C' button resets the display to an empty state.
